# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data using LSTM

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics. The dataset used is from Kaggle's Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Loaded and preprocessed the dataset to remove missing values and noise.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to identify trends and relationships between variables. Visualized sentiment distribution and word frequencies.
3. **Modeling with LSTM:** Built a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to classify the sentiment of social media posts. Achieved a model accuracy of **94%**.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using accuracy metrics and visualized the confusion matrix for deeper insights.

### Files:
- **train.csv:** Training dataset used for model training.
- **test.csv:** Test dataset used for evaluating the model.
- **Kaggle Notebook:** All the code was run on Kaggleâ€™s notebook environment.

### Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Kaggle environment)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

### Results:
- The LSTM model achieved a precision of **94%**, indicating strong performance in classifying social media sentiment.
